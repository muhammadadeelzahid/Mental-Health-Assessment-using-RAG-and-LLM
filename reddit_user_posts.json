    "Can your environment make a big difference to your mental health?\nI'm talking only environment change, no change in anything else. I feel like for me the place I'm on changes how I feel drastically even if I keep the other things the same. Currently feel like shit and nothing excites me anymore whereas I used to be excited for things. The only thing that's changed in my life has been my environment (as I moved).",
    "Is life genuinely worth it if 80% of the time is suffering and 20% is actual rewarding fun that feels fulfilling?\nI never understood why we live a life where we suffer considerably more than we actually have fun. I read about people online and see people in real having to suffer, make sacrifices just to be able to scrape by and live on. I understand I am more privileged than lots of people in this world, but even then it doesn't seem worth it if I just slave away and suffer. I've already given up on so many things I was once interested in because I just don't have the time or energy to do them anymore. What's the point if surviving is just suffering?",
    "Is it weird that I've been alone so much I actually enjoy it more than hanging out with people.\nI've gotten to the point I actually enjoy doing stuff all alone and would choose it over hanging out with friends and stuff. Don't know what has happened but I feel more at peace.",
    "Lost confidence in myself and my abilities.\nI remember years ago I used to be confident in my abilities to do well, perform well and always knew what I was capable of achieving. Fast forward a few years I started losing my confidence, second guessing myself and my things I did. I quit competitive sports completely due to it and couldn't handle the pressure. Slowly, it has trickled into every facet of my life, from academics to just normal everyday life. Slowly but surely I'm losing my passion and abilities in things I used to excel at and enjoyed. It sucks because from an outside perspective, I live such a wonderful and amazing life. I'm very thankful for what my parents were able to provide for me and the opportunities that arise with it. It feels like at some point in my life I did something wrong or took the wrong turn and ended up spiraling into failure after failure. I keep trying to tell myself that things will get better and try to have a positive outlook, but weeks/months later it just comes crashing down again. I think I get too disheartened when I fail too easily but I just can't seem to change it.",

Then the instant I'm connecting with other people, I start to feel shit again and my mind goes into overdrive again and I just end up exhausted and close off. Anyone else feel this way?",
    "Does depression and anxiety make you dumber?\nFeeling very dumb at the moment but also very stressed out and depressed.",

    "Struggle with feeling stupid despite getting good grades\nDon't know where else to post this.\n\nDespite getting good grades, I'm always doubting my abilities and overthink a lot about my intelligence. I often get anxious about my test abilities and find myself doing the same questions over and over just to make sure. It sucks feeling stupid all the time even if the results contradict this feeling.",

    "Always feel like my friends are more productive/successful than me and that I'm wasting time and being lazy.\nI always have this feeling when I hear about my friends and what they are doing and I always downplay my own achievements and tell myself I'm not doing enough. How do I get rid of this feeling?",

    "I also want to add that especially in current circumstances with economical problems, it seems as though suffering and grinding through something gives you even less of a rewarding feeling as it did in the past. People spend so much time getting degrees just to come out and struggle to find a job that pays a decent enough salary to be able to live fairly comfortably. It just doesn't add up to me.",

    "How do I handle health anxiety\nI'm having kind of a health anxiety episode right now because I banged the top of my head on a shelf on accident last Thursday and I didn't get any symptoms but I saw a video of someone banging their head and everyone in the comments were freaking out telling her she has to go hospital. So it worried me and it send me on a spiral of searching online my symptoms and stuff, even tho Ik you're not supposed to do that, I just can't help it. \n\nis there any tips to help my anxiety because I often get worried about health related things and I just want to know things that can help now and in the future.",
    "I hate social media so much\nI just saw a video on social media saying \"this is what a true midsize body looks like, stay delusional\". Wtf? She had a thigh gap and looked like the wore size XS clothes. I know it's rude to talk about people's weight but I think this is slightly deserved considering she just told everyone that if they're calling themselves skinny at that size, they're delusional. It just really annoyed me and I had to make a post about it because she looked like she could be a model on a runway, yet was making everyone beleive that was midsize. It's sad how shockingly brainwashed everyone is on social media to the point people are saying that being severely underweight is the healthiest. Something else rlly annoying is when people say \"nothing tastes better than being skinny\"? Yes there is? Ever went to Prezzo? Omg it makes me so angry.\n\nWhen will people stop promoting eating disorders?! I saw another video a while ago of a girl posing on the camera with a text that said \"my doctor just told me I'm severely underweight\" and she was acting as if that was a good thing and was showing off her body?! People on the comments were saying shit like \"she's just jealous\" or \"no you're just not a fatty\" WTF?! I can assure you she isn't jealous she is just doing her job and telling you that you need to eat more?!. \n\nYk what also annoys me? When people who smoke, do drugs and eat only ice cubes say that they're healthier than a bigger person just because they're skinnier. I'm sorry, but just because you're skinnier doesn't meant that the smoking, drugs and undereating you do will make it healthier than someone who is a bit bigger.",
    "How do I stop feeling so uncomfortable about the topic of sex?\nI am asexual and haven't even kissed anyone nor held anyones hands before, and I know for a fact I never want to have sex, I've known in the past and I know for the future. However, I also get really uncomfortable talking about sex, for example, if my friends are talking about their experiences, i actually feel like I'm about to have a panic attack, why? I don't know. \n\nI don't understand why this happens, because I know many people just don't like talking about sex, but for me it's FAR worse than just feeling slightly uncomfortable.Ive cried before over my friends talking about their experiences, and I get the symptoms I usually get before I have a panic attack (heart racing, shaking, tears, anxiety). \n\nI just need to know how to stop this and I can't go to therapy for it (please don't ask me to explain why). Should I should have a talk with my friends about how it makes me uncomfortable? I was going to but I felt as though it would be rude because they should feel safe talking about personal things with their friends.",

The thing is though, while I'm showering it's great and wonderful and relaxing, and the cleanliness after is amazing, but before I shower it is just so hard to motivate myself to. Any tips? I was thinking maybe I could reward myself after but I need more tips",
    "Ive only been brushing my teeth at night and I'm so ashamed\nI used to have horrible mental health and genuinely never used to brush my teeth, like maybe once a week or even less,my dentists and orthodontists scared me into brushing my teeth and finally I started brushing them every day and night! But recently, my motivation has been so low because of school and work etc, so I've genuinely not been motivated to brush my teeth in the morning for about 2 weeks now.. I really need to know if that's gonna make my dentist dissappointed or if it's gonna ruin my teeth. I brush them for like 3 sometimes even 4 minutes at night very thoroughly and I wear a retainer after. Are my teeth gonna be okay? I'm really going to try to brush them in the morning too but it's so hard to motivate myself to. Can someone also give me tips or something on how to start brushing twice a day again? I'm having a dentist appointment soon and I really don't want to dissapoint my dentist all over again",
    "Anxiety about war\n!I'm in the Uk!

I'm genuinely freaking out right now this will ruin my whole week and I don't know if he was joking or not but I'm genuinely terrified. Please someone reassure me or something I'm so scared",
    "How do I deal with a suicidal friend\nMy friend has bad mental health and often doesn't want to admit it. Theyve done self harm and attempted before. Im not going to say any personal information about them, obviously. But anyway, they texted me while attempting one time and it made me have an awful panic attack, obviously I told my mum so she could sort it out because I'm just a teenager. After that I constantly told them how much I love them and was very careful in how I spoke to them to make sure they didn't try again or I didn't trigger them, but they always joke about commiting and I feel mean saying this, but it's really tiring. They send me into a panic attack much to often because they say stuff like \"an hour's time I'm gonna be gone\" or \"if I don't wake up....\", But then they're fine and chatting like normal after? I feel awful for saying this, I'm not trying to blame it on them , I just don't know what to do, I had a panic attack earlier BC they did it again and I just want to sleep in peace but I really can't because I'm constantly worried about them. They always do it right after I say I want to sleep too, like, I say \"sorry I gtg now I gtg sleep\", and then an hour later they say stuff like that and don't reply for the whole night and I have a panic attack, but in the morning they're happy and apparently did nothing and say they were just trolling. Pls help I hate living in panic but they're my best friend but I don't want to have to deal with this I'm not a proffesional and I always tell people not to vent to me",
    "Is it normal to have completely different personalities every day?\nI always thought this was normal but my friend pointed it out and apparently it's not too normal. Basically, I have COMPLETELY different personalities every day, it's not just a small change, it's big. One day I'll act like a chill dude who dresses basic and talks like every other dude, the next day I'll be all pink and cutesy and using emoticons and stuff, and then the next day I'll dress rlly dark and alternative. I'm social one day, not social the other. And it's not just a small change, it's like a completely different person everyday. One day I'll imagine my future as a strong muscular man or sum, and the next day I'll imagine myself as a cutesy guy with a room full of pink in the future. Even with my sexuality it will change, straight one day gay the other bisexual the next. I don't know if it's something \"wrong\" with me or if I'm being dramatic.",
    "Please how do I get arid of health anxiety?!\nI have the worst health anxiety ever. I always get panick attacks because I think I'm dying because I have one symptom of something. I don't know how to get arid of it tho, it's ruining my life, I can't spend a day without crying about the fact I might have a life-threatening disease despite doctors never saying anything about one.",
    "Could this be schizophrenia or something else?? \nI have paranoia often. It's mainly about my brother, but it gets pretty bad. I have to stand at my door to hold it shut because I get worried he's going to attack me, or I lock myself in the bathroom. He's never done anything bad to me other than normal sibling rivalry, but I still get terrified. I can't even help him or go near him when he's sick and delerious because I get scared he might attack me without thinking. There was a day once I locked myself in my bathroom for atleast 4 hours just because he was sleep talking. Don't think he's a bad person or a danger, he's not, it's just my mind thinking he'd do something yk? It's not just my brother, it's also my cat, which makes me so sad because I love my cat so much to the point I spend every single day with her, but I often get scared that she will just turn one day and attack me.\n\n Another thing, I often talk to myself, and I know that's normal but it gets to a point I won't do work because I'll be too busy talking to myself. It's the only way I get myself through the day. I can literally just stare at a wall and talk to myself for hours on end and not get bored.\n\nThird thing, I get terrified that someone will shoot me or something one day even tho I live in a country where guns are banned unless you have a licence. Let me explain, I can be in my car as usual, but then I'll get a random intense fear that someone in a car next to me will shoot me. It happens tons, when I'm showering, driving, in my room just living, and it's not just normal anxiety, I genuinely flinch or duck down at the thought of someone potentially doing that because I think it might save me.\n\nLast thing, I often feel things crawling in me, but it's not like I genuinely believe it, I know there's nothing there, but I just feel like it. I often think that's just a thing ppl get and I'm trying to force a mental illness on myself or make myself sound crazy for some reason.\n\nWhat could this be?!",
    "How do I stop worrying about my weight\nI'm a teenager and I never used to he ashamed of my weight, but recently I have been. I thought we got past the \"nothing tastes better than being skinny\" era back in like the 90's (obviously I wasn't born then but I hear often that being skinny was the thing back then) but it's coming back. I was always so proud of being so secure of my weight and never being ashamed of it, but now I'm really feeling bad about it. I'm 5'6 and weigh about 65kg and apparently that's overweight. I never thought I looked overweight but apparently I am. :(",

I'm not asking for help, I'm just asking what this is called, my friend said it's just anxiety but idk. Lmk tyy",

    "Hmm well I wouldn't say it makes me paniky trying to think about my past, but thinking about the few past memories I do actually remember make me anxious, I believed that was just because I'm trans though.\n\nAnd interacting with men does make me anxious quite a lot, it does depend on the man though, but most men, yeah. I also sometimes get intrusive thoughts when I'm with a man that, obviously, I very much do not want to have, so idk if that's related or just because of suspected ocd \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
    "Yes, I do this too! Nostalgia is a strong strong emotion and its the best yet also worst emotion ever.\u00a0\n\nJust remember though, crying is a good thing, it may not he about much of a good thing, but crying is so good for you mentally, so it's actually good that you have to cry about these things sometimes.\n\nAlso, im aware you weren't really asking for advice, but just know, it may feel very sad thinking about your past and how much you've changed now, but you will listen to songs you listen to now in the future and get the same sense of nostalgia, whether it be good or bad, that you are feeling now. Even if your life isn't the best now, im sure that future you will think about present you and think about the happy things that have happened. Sorry if that is badly worded..\n\nAnd try to think about how, yes, you don't have the same freedom you did as a kid, but that just means you are growing and getting stronger as a person, and you are living life. Living life doesn't always need to mean partying all the time or going out with people or going on holidays, it can also just mean surviving everyday and having different emotions everyday etc..\u00a0\n\nSorry for the long paragraph I just wanted to say all of this!

When they meet they\u2019re like \u201cshe was so much fatter than I thought she would be and I ghosted her.\u201d I have asked the guys I\u2019ve met from online if I look like my pics and they all looked confused like \u201cum yeah?\u201d",
    "Why does cuddling, kissing, and doing sexual things with a guy make me feel better?\nI\u2019m a very lonely person at times. Sometimes I don\u2019t mind being alone. However other times I just want to be with a guy. Seriously I would drive in bad weather in the middle of the night just to go be with someone. When it\u2019s all over, I\u2019m all sad again.",
    "Why do I want love and affection from men so badly?\nI don\u2019t care if we do anything sexual. I just want to hug, cuddle, kiss, and want them to want and chase after me. If they eventually ghost or reject me then I feel like I can\u2019t go on with life.",
    "What should I do after acting so weird around this guy?\nI have been talking to this guy on tinder for probably a month. A couple weeks ago he asked me to come to his house so we could watch a movie and cuddle at like 11pm. At first I didn\u2019t want to but I ended up going. When I got there he came outside and gave me a hug and kissed me on the forehead. I froze up and just stood by my car playing on my phone. I contemplated going back to my car and leaving but he just stood there awkwardly looking at me. I eventually went in. We went to his bedroom and he was like \u201cI want you to pick what we watch.\u201d I said I didn\u2019t care but he\u2019s like \u201cI told you to pick.\u201d I finally said \u201cforensic files\u201d and he\u2019s like \u201cperfect!\u201d He got into his bed and asked me to get in with him. I asked him why he wanted to cuddle with me and why he couldn\u2019t find someone else. He\u2019s like \u201cI chose you. I wanted you to come over.\u201d I just awkwardly stood there for a minute wanting to leave again but I ended up getting into his bed. \n\n\nWe cuddled for a couple minutes but I just looked down the entire time. He asked me what was wrong and I said I was fine. He ended up kissing me and we made out. He fingered me a little bit and asked if I was feeling more relaxed. I was a little more comfortable but still extremely awkward. We made out again and I gave him a handjob while we were kissing, which eventually turned into a blowjob. \n\n\nHe got up to go to the bathroom and I stood up and was standing by the edge of his bed. He came back into the bedroom and asked if I was leaving. I just shrugged my shoulders. He asked me what was wrong and was like \u201cyou look so disappointed. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re extremely nervous or shy or what. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d I got back into his bed but faced away from him. He wrapped his arms around me and asked me to face him which I did. He got on top of me and tried pulling my pants off. I pulled them back up and he said he wanted to eat me out. He kissed me again and we cuddled for a while. He eventually fell asleep and I took off and ran out the door. \n\n\nHe keeps messaging me and asking me if I want to come over on the weekends. At first I didn\u2019t really like him in that way but now I\u2019m starting to possibly have feelings for him. I don\u2019t really want to but I do. However, I just feel like it\u2019s all going to end up blowing up in my face.",
    "How do you stop feeling awkward during sex when you\u2019re fat?\nIt just feels awkward. I feel weird moaning and stuff. The guy kissed and sucked my neck and I was ready to explode. Oh my goodness! It felt soooo amazing! However I tried to hide how I felt. One time this guy and I were having sex and I jokingly said \u201cfuck me harder!\u201d he laughed at me and was like \u201chaha what?\u201d Then I felt stupid and embarrassed. This guy tried pulling my pants off so he could go down on me but I didn\u2019t want him to see my fat body.",
    "How do you express or use as an outlet for your inner pain and fears?\nI know I\u2019m a piece of shit. I don\u2019t deserve happiness and probably will never be happy. No guy will ever want me; I\u2019m too fat and ugly. Everyone hates me, but I hate myself the most. I want to be numb so I can\u2019t feel anything. I have a lot of anxiety and I don\u2019t like it. Nothing calms me down.",
    "I\u2019m so pissed off at myself right now. What should I do?\nI really wanted to see this guy. I met him a couple weeks ago. I really started to like him though. He asked me if I wanted to come over and I said yes. However when I got to his house it was glare ice and I couldn\u2019t even walk on it. I just took off and went back home. I just feel horrible. What should I do? I don\u2019t think he even noticed I was there. He\u2019s probably not going to talk to me again at this rate. I have really strange anxiety about ice.",
    "Why would a person act so strange when going to someone\u2019s house?\nI sometimes talk to this person on a dating app. They live pretty close by. One night I asked them if they wanted to come over and cuddle. At first they said no but later said \u201cmaybe for an hour or so.\u201d They ended up coming over. They asked me to come outside when they got there. I gave them a hug and thanked them for coming over. They acted weird and just stood by their car for like a minute. My driveway was kind of icey and they said they didn\u2019t want to walk on that. However they ended up coming in. We went to my bedroom and I asked them what they wanted to watch. I asked them if they wanted to cuddle. At first they acted like they didn\u2019t want to get in the bed but eventually climbed in. They just buried their head in my chest and just looked down the entire time. We ended up making out a little bit which seemed to help them relax. They just looked and acted like something was bothering them and kept weirdly looking at their phone. I asked them to tell what was bothering them but they said they were fine. They seemed like they were going to cry or something. They stayed for like an hour or so. When I started falling asleep they took off and left. However, now they keep asking me what I\u2019m doing this weekend. We are both 30.",
    "How do you go on dates in public when you\u2019re fat and ugly?\nThis dude from an online dating app asked me if I want to hangout/go on a date. He was suggesting things like dinner, going to see a movie, bowling. I cannot eat in front of people. I just can\u2019t. The movies presents another issue. I\u2019m like 240 and I don\u2019t know if I can even fit in the seats. I haven\u2019t been to a movie in like 20 years. I have a body pic on the app. I even jokingly said to him \u201cyou know I\u2019m not skinny right?\u201d He said \u201cyes. You know I\u2019m not skinny right?\u201d On top of that I\u2019m afraid he might run away or stand me up if he sees me. I met another guy from the dating app last week. I asked him if I look like my pics and he said yes. I\u2019m afraid maybe someone will try to embarrass me or stare at us or something. On top of that I get so nervous where I want to vomit and \u201cfreeze\u201d up. I get panic/anxiety attacks sometimes and I just run away. If anything goes wrong, I dip.",
    "How do you accept that no guy will ever want you?\nNobody likes me anyway so why try anymore. I really like this guy but he\u2019s probably interested in someone else.",
    "Why does dating give me anxiety and depression so bad?\nI have wanted a boyfriend for so long. However, it seems like every guy I meet I\u2019m not attracted to. I have only had one serious boyfriend but I didn\u2019t have deep feelings for him but liked him. I really like this 40-year-old guy I have been talking to on tinder. I really want to meet him but I\u2019m afraid once he meets me that maybe he\u2019ll never talk to me again. I tried so hard to try to hangout with him today but he ended up going hunting after work. Then today he says he\u2019s going to be super busy with his deer and stuff. \n\n\nA few hours ago another guy on tinder asked me if I wanted to come over. I didn\u2019t really want to but ended up going to his house. We cuddled on his bed and talked a little bit. Then we ended up making out and I gave him a blowjob. I just wasn\u2019t feeling it. He was a nice guy but I just wasn\u2019t attracted to him. I think he knew something was up because he kept asking me what\u2019s wrong. He ended up falling asleep about two hours after I got there. I just snuck out and left. \n\n\nEver since my anxiety has been through the roof and I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Maybe because I have deep feelings for the 40 year old or what. \n\n\nWhy am I like this?",
    "Yeah but most of them actually wanted to date me",
    "What the hell are you talking about?",
    "How did he assault me?",
    "I don\u2019t know if I can. I haven\u2019t been to a theater in years",
    "I have lost a lot of weight recently",
    "No I\u2019m not physically fit so I should throw in the towel?",
    "I fall in love hard and fast",
    "Is that even legal?",
    "Why are you typing in another language?",
    "You can say sex. You don\u2019t need to bleep it out.",
    "It\u2019s usually after sex."
